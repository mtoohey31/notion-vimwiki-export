# Notion Vimwiki Markdown Export

A work in progress project for converting Notion Markdown & CSV exports to a Vimwiki markdown compatible formats. To be clear, this is designed to output to a flavour of markdown compatible with Wimwiki, not to Vimwiki's usual syntax. At this point, "work in progress" means it's not usable yet, though I hope it will be soon :smile:.

This project current makes use of [Panflute](https://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute/) for parsing markdown files, among other tools.
